/** This is the package level documentation for the package 
 * `org.my.parent.child`. Note that this documentation
 * uses Wiki markup rather than plain vanilla HTML. This
 * makes it:
 *
 * - Easier to write.
 * - Easier to read by a maintainer looking at the code
 *   rather than the docs in a web browser.
 * - More likely to work when written to some other format.
 *
 * This Scaladoc comment documents both the package, and 
 * the "package object".
